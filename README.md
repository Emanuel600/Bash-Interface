# Bash-Interface

  I want to create a program that can interface several executables together, all while sending information between them. I initially thought of using this as a 'network of code', where multiple different languages would interact with each other(mostly Python and C) and this will be a proof of concept.
  
  The main goal of this project in particular will be to receive data through one piece of code, process it through another and then finally produce a result on a final piece. This is to look into automation of processes via bash scripting.
  
  The data will be randomly generated at first, but eventually I'll change it to download or log the data from a source and pre-process it with an algorithm and then pass the result through an executable tha may provide further insight(like a predictive model).
