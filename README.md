# Bash-Interface

  I want to create a program that can interface several executables together, all while sending information between them. This will be done in the form of a command script that will handle I/O between all the executables. I'll start with a proof of concept, where data is randomly generated, sorted and finally analysed. Later I'll see to it that it gathers data from a source and process it accordingly.
